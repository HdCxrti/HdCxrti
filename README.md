# Hi, I'm Jake Dutra

I'm a self-taught software developer with a hands-on background in the automotive industry. I recently transitioned from full-time mechanic to full-time developer, bringing my problem-solving mindset and real-world grit into every line of code I write.

My long-term goal is to become a full stack developer working on real world software that solves meaningful problems, from industrial systems to user facing applications.
